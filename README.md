Here are some tips for the best Python project folder structure:

Make a root folder for your project and give it a meaningful name
Within the root, create separate folders for:
src - This will contain all your .py source code files
tests - This will contain your test scripts and files
docs - For documentation like README.md
data - For any data files your code needs
logs - For log files that get generated
config - For any configuration/settings files
notebooks - For Jupyter or Colab notebooks related to the project
Use lowercase letters and underscores for folder names
Try to modularize your code, so have separate folders for different modules/packages
Have a main.py in src that ties everything together as the entry point
Use relative imports like from .submodule import foo within packages
Have an outer LICENSE, README, requirements.txt at the project root
Use .gitignore to avoid committing temporary files
Consider using a src/ directory or namespace packages for larger projects

The key points:

src contains all source code organized into modules
tests contains test scripts
notebooks for any Jupyter notebooks
docs for documentation
data and logs are also useful folders
Top level files like requirements.txt and LICENSE
Overall clean and modular structure
This can serve as a template for most small to medium Python projects.
