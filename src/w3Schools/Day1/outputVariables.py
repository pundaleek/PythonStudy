# Output Variables
# The Python print() function is often used to output variables.

# x = "Pythos is awesome"
# print(x)

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
# print("x, y, z : "+ x, y, z)
# print(x+y+z)

x = 100
y = 200
z = 300
# print("x, y, z : "+ x, y, z)
print(x, y, z)
print(x+y+z)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# throws exception
x = 5
y = "abc"
print(x + y)
