'''
Precedence of Operator

The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python, from highest precedence (most binding) to lowest precedence (least binding). 
Operators in the same box have the same precedence. Unless the syntax is explicitly given, operators are binary. 
Operators in the same box group left to right (except for exponentiation and conditional expressions, which group from right to left).
